🛡️ IPTF_AbuAli – Integrated Penetration Testing Framework
An integrated, automated, and scalable penetration testing framework for modern ICT applications
License: MIT

Python 3.8+

Build Status

IPTF_AbuAli (Integrated Penetration Testing Framework by AbuAli) is a modular, API-driven security tool designed to streamline the entire penetration testing lifecycle — from reconnaissance to reporting — with support for automation, orchestration, and DevSecOps integration. 

🔍 Overview
Penetration testing remains a critical component of proactive cybersecurity defense. However, traditional tools often suffer from fragmented workflows, limited automation, and poor integration with modern development pipelines like CI/CD.

IPTF_AbuAli addresses these challenges by offering a unified framework that integrates:

Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering
Vulnerability Scanning
Exploitation Engine
Post-Exploitation Simulation
Reporting & Remediation Dashboard
All modules are orchestrated via Python scripts and RESTful APIs, enabling seamless execution and embedding within software delivery pipelines.

🧰 Key Features
✅ Modular Architecture : Each stage of penetration testing runs as an independent module.
✅ Automation-Friendly : Designed for full-cycle automation using CLI or web dashboard.
✅ CI/CD Integration : Embed directly into GitLab CI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.
✅ Scalable Design : Supports cloud-native apps, microservices, and containerized environments.
✅ Extensible : Easily plug in new tools via configuration files.
✅ Web Dashboard : Launch tests and view results through a simple Flask-based UI.
✅ Standardized Reporting : Export findings in JSON, XML, or PDF formats.

📦 Requirements
✅ Python 3.8+
🐳 Docker (for containerization)
⚙️ Ansible (for orchestration)
🌐 Supported OS: Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), Windows (via WSL), macOS
🚀 Quick Start
🔹 Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/AbuAli1393/iptf-abuali.git
cd iptf-abuali
🔹 Install Dependencies
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
🔹 Run a Test (CLI Mode)
bash

python run_iptf.py --target example.com --mode full
Available modes:

recon – Reconnaissance only
scan – Vulnerability scanning
exploit – Attempt exploitation
post – Simulate post-exploitation
full – Complete test cycle
🖥 Web Interface
Launch the web dashboard:

bash

cd web
python app.py

Then visit:
🔗 http://localhost:5000
